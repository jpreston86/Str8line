      I was born in Las Vegas, Nevada and went to school in Akron, Ohio. I apprenticed under the tattoo artist, Matt Lettau, in Akron, Ohio. I specialize in custom black and grey, but am well rounded in all other forms of tattooing. During my apprenticeship, Matt always stressed how important straight lines were to the structure of your tattoo. Not long after my apprenticeship I opened Art-N-Soul Tattoo & Body Piercing in Akron, Ohio. My stepson PJ and I decided to move to Florida not long after my father's death in 2007. In 2008 I opened Str8Line Tattoo & Body Piercings here in Fort Myers.

      I go by PJ and have lived in Florida for about 9 years. Str8line Tattoo & Body Piercings has been open and operating since. I have always had an interest for drawing, but it wasn't until I was 16 when I developed the attraction to be a professional tattoo artist. Once David saw my interest in the profession, he offered me an apprenticeship. My life has never been the same. My apprenticeship lasted about a year an half ending in 2005 and I am very thankful to have had such a great teacher. Today I specialize in Color and New Skool, but am comfortable in all forms of tattoo art.
